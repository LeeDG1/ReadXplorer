        <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Windows Setup:</strong></span>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            We offer a pre-build GNU R package for Windows that contains all necessary R packages.
            <br/>
            Within ReadXplorer go to "Tools" &rarr; "Options" &rarr; "GNU R" and select "Download and Install GNU R".
            <br/>
            After accepting the License the download will start automatically and a progress indicator will appear. When the installation is finished you can use the differential expression analysis located in the "Tool" menu.

        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            The Mac OS Version of ReadXplorer comes with a bundled GNU R installation. After installation you can use all the differential gene expression analysis functions directly, no further setup is needed.

        <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Linux Setup:</strong></span>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            As there are so many different versions of Linux we do not offer an automatic installation on Linux systems. However, the GNU R configuration page located within ReadXplorer ("Tools" &rarr; "Options" &rarr; "GNU R") offers advanced setup options that allow different setup scenarios on Linux system. It is possible to run the R instance on your local machine as well as connecting to a GNU R instance running on a remote host. A few setup examples are given below.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Installing a GNU R instance:</span>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            For each scenario the machine that should run GNU R needs the required Software at first. Obviously, the first thing that needs to be installed is GNU R itself. The GNU R versions we use for Mac OS and Windows is 3.2.0, other 3.X versions should work as well, but we did not test them. There are GNU R packages included in most Linux distribution you can use or you can download the source-code at https://www.r-project.org/ . Which way is the best to go depends on your personal preferences and the Linux distribution you are using.
            <br/>
            After installing GNU R you also need to download the required, additional R packages used by ReadXplorer. For the connection between ReadXplorer and GNU R we need "RServe", which can be installed in an open R session by typing "install.packages(“Rserve”)". We also need the packages for "baySeq", "DESeq" and "DESeq2". These packages are hosted on http://bioconductor.org/ where you can also find installation instructions. Once everything is installed we are ready to setup the connection in one of the ways described below.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size: 11pt;">Connect to a manually started GNU R instance (local or remote)</span>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            Once GNU R and all the necessary packages are installed you can start the RServe instance in different ways. When within a running GNU R session type "library(Rserve" and then "Rserve()" to start the RServe Server instance. You can also start the RServe server directly from the commandline by executing "R CMD Rserve" provided the R is correctly included in your PATH. After executing one of these commands you will have a running RServe instance listening on its default port 6311 for connections. Please be aware that if you are on a multi user system every one with access to the machine can now connect to this RServe instance which is running with your user privileges. Because GNU R is capable of accessing the local file system this also means that this person can gain access to you files. So if you are on a multiuser system please check the RServe manual on how to setup a password protected connection. The manual also describes how to setup RServe to allow remote connections. This is especially useful if you want to provide one central R instance in your network which can than be used by different users at the same time.
        <br/>
            In a final step the ReadXplorer settings need to be adjusted to connect to the local (or remote) running RServe instance. Within Readxplorer go to "Tools" &rarr; "Options" &rarr; "GNU R" and select "Manual". Your must now enter the IP Address or Hostname of the machine running RServe as well as the port. If the Rserve instance requires authentication check the "Use authentication" checkbox and enter a valid "Username" and "Password" combination. ReadXplorer will store the credentials in the key storage provided by you operating system. If your RServe instance is running on your local machine (the same machine you are running ReadXplorer on) and you haven't changed the default port you can just use the default settings ("localhost" as "RServe Host" and "6311" as "RServe Port"). You should now be able to run the differential gene expression analysis located in the "Tools" menu.
