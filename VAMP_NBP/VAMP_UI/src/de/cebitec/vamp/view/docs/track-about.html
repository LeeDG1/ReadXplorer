        <h2>General Viewer Navigation</h2>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            First of all: All viewers are synchronized across all opened tracks, for easy navigation and comparison of data.
            Each viewer allows to jump to any position, by drawing the horizontal scrollbar on top of each viewer. Besides that, panning can be
            used to scroll through the vincinity of the current position. 
            <br>Each viewer, which also has a slider beneath the horizontal scrollbar also allows zooming in and out. Another way of zooming is 
            to move the mouse wheel while hovering the viewer. In this case, when zoomed in, the view centers around the currently hovered position.
            <br>Each viewer also always allows copying the current mouse position via right click.
        </p>

        <h2>About VAMP's Reference Viewer</h2>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            The reference viewer, which has to be opened before a track can be viewed, visualizes the reference sequence (genome, chromosome...)
            with its features (if they are available -> fasta files don't inculde features) in all 6 reading frames.
            <br>The features can be selected via left click and their additional menu can be opened via right click. If an features was clicked
            it can be added to the thumbnail view, and it's sequence can be copied or stored.
            <br>The legend panel in the top left corner allows to browse the supported feature types and also allows to show or hide each feature
            type.
        </p>

        <h2>About VAMP's Track Viewer</h2>
        <p style="font-size:0.9em">
            The track viewer displays the coverage of it's reference sequence in the current dataset. The coverage is divided into three different
            classes: 
            <br>1. Perfect coverage: Depicts all mapped reads that perfectly fit to the reference at their mapping position (0 sequence deviations)
            <br>2. Best match coverage: Depicts all mapped reads, that fit to this mapping position best (with least possible sequence deviation rate)
            <br>3. Common Coverage: Depicts all mapped reads, that still fit to this mapping position with the maximal allowed error rate during 
            the mapping process, but there is another position in the reference, where they fit with less sequence deviations.
            <br>The legend panel in the top left corner allows to browse the coloring of these three classes and also enables the you to show or hide each class.
            <br>The options panel next to the legend panel contains two functionalities currently:
            <br>1. Enable or Disable automatic scaling of the coverage. If enabled, the coverage will never exceed the visible area of the viewer
            <br>2. Coverage normalization either by log2 or by a factor of your own choice (between 0 and 10)
        </p>

        <h2>About VAMP's Track Statistics</h2>
        <p>
            TODO: The meaning of the track statistic values will be described here.
