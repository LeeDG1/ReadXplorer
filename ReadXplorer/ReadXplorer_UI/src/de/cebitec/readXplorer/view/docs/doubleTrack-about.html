        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Double Track Viewer visualizes the coverage differences between exactly two tracks. This viewer uses the complete coverage (see <i>Read Classification</i>) of both tracks. It can be accessed via the respective toolbar icon (see <i>Main Window a)</i>) or "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tools -&gt; Double Track Viewer</span>". In the background the coverage of track one is painted in orange, then the coverage of track two is painted on the middle layer in cyan. On the front layer, the coverage difference is painted in dark blue. In the example, the coverage difference between both analyzed tracks is quite consistent. The tooltip shows the complete coverage of both tracks and the coverage difference for the hovered position.</p>
